# ApplePodcast

Listen to some podcast while you're on the road! 

## How I did this? 

Through hours of tutorials and learning tricks here and there, I've learned many new features.  
Brian Voong also known for his YouTube channel **Lets Build That App https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuP2vJ6kRutQBfRmdcI92mA** creates great swift content, mostly programmatically, and shows how certain UIKit classes work.
