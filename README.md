# ApplePodcast

Listen to some podcast while you're on the road! 

## How I did this? 

Through hours of tutorials and learning tricks here and there, I've learned many new features and coded it **Programmatically & XIBs** 

Brian Voong also known for his YouTube channel **Lets Build That App** creates great swift content, most of it written programmatically, and shows how certain UIKit classes work. 

Here's his YouTube Link! **https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuP2vJ6kRutQBfRmdcI92mA**
